# 🛡️ FTP Analyzer - Passive FTP Traffic Sniffer

`ftp_analyzer` is a lightweight, CLI-based tool built in Python to monitor and analyze FTP traffic on a given network interface.

It is designed for **ethical hacking**, **traffic analysis**, and detection of **insecure FTP usage**. This tool passively listens for FTP connections, logs activity, and detects clear-text credentials (usernames & passwords). It also monitors connection frequency and flags IPs showing suspicious behavior — such as brute-force attempts or mass scanning.

## ✨ Features

- 📡 **Passive FTP Sniffing** – No active interference or MITM; listens quietly on TCP port 21.
- 🧠 **Credential Capture** – Detects and displays FTP `USER` and `PASS` commands sent in plaintext.
- 🚨 **Suspicious Behavior Alerts** – Tracks connection counts per IP and raises alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
- 📄 **Interactive Logging** – Optionally save logs to files after each run, avoiding unnecessary disk writes.
- 🌐 **Hostname Resolution** – Tries to resolve destination IPs to readable hostnames.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- Uses `scapy` to sniff network traffic on a specified interface.
- Filters for packets on **TCP port 21** (standard FTP).
- Every packet is inspected:
  - If it contains FTP commands (`USER`, `PASS`), they are parsed and printed.
  - Logs every connection from a source IP to track session count.
  - If an IP exceeds a defined connection threshold (default: 5), an alert is triggered.
- All output is printed live to the terminal.
- At the end of the session, the user is prompted to optionally save logs.

## 🛠️ Use Cases

Here’s where `ftp_analyzer` shines:

- ✅ **CTF challenges** – Capture credentials during a misconfigured FTP service.
- ✅ **Internal Network Audits** – Check for insecure FTP traffic in corp networks.
- ✅ **Lab Monitoring** – Run in a test environment to see how protocols behave.
- ✅ **Educational Use** – Great for learning how sniffers, packet analyzers, and FTP work.
- ❌ Not for intercepting secure protocols (FTP over TLS is not parsed).

## 📥 Installation & Setup

You can install and run `ftp_analyzer` in just a few steps:

### ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `scapy` library
- A system with network interface access (Linux, macOS, WSL, or Kali recommended)

---

### 📦 Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KDh3h3/ftp_analyzer.git
cd ftp_analyzer
📦 Step 2: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
💡 If pip is not installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
🔐 Step 3: Run the Tool (as root/admin)
Use sudo because sniffing requires elevated privileges:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 ftp_analyzer.py -i <interface>
Replace <interface> with your system's active network interface:

lo → for localhost (good for testing with local FTP)

eth0, wlan0, etc. → for wired/wireless sniffing

🧪 Example for Localhost Testing
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 ftp_analyzer.py -i lo
In another terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
ftp 127.0.0.1
Use any dummy credentials — the tool will sniff them and print to screen.
